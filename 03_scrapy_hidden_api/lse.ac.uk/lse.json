forms they take, as well as studying real world social problems and the ethical dilemmas faced by our contemporary world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The BSc Sociology programme explores specific examples of social action, social processes and institutions; compares different types of social life and societies; examines theories about the nature of social existence and change; studies different methods of social research; and allows you to undertake research of your own.</p>\r\n<p>LSE Sociology is one of the premier sociology departments in the world, providing cutting-edge research-led teaching delivered by international experts in their field. Ours was the first sociology department in the United Kingdom and has played a unique role in defining and developing the discipline &ndash; nationally and internationally &ndash; since 1904. <br /> <br /> The Department provides a learning environment in which students develop a firm grasp of the key dimensions of contemporary sociology, and are encouraged to think critically and independently. Many of the key issues in the discipline worldwide are contested and our teaching enables students to understand and evaluate these disputes and adopt a position in relation to them. Rigorous, critical and independent thought is the most transferable skill of all, and is the overarching objective of the learning experience we provide to our students.</p>\r\n<p>Students on this programme also have the opportunity to receive a language specialism attached to their degree certificate and transcript - see the programme structure and courses section.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a accesskey=\"Listen to our podcast\" title=\"Listen to our podcast\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZJlFxDavpc\">Listen to our podcast</a> on studying sociology at LSE, recorded at one of our Undergraduate Open Days.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

make up the majority of the degree.</p>\r\n<p>International social and public policy covers real world issues such as poverty, disadvantage, international development, and welfare and work. It is about understanding and addressing social problems in society, and it examines the formation and implementation of policy, and how this affects people&rsquo;s wellbeing. The subject is diverse and exciting, and plays a crucial role in contemporary politics. The study of government involves analysing the ways in which individuals and groups define and interpret political issues and seek to shape government decisions.</p>\r\n<p>Social policy and politics are closely linked. The social policies you see around you were not created in a vacuum but reflect an accumulation of decisions in which political behaviour by citizens and their representatives, and governments and other organisations at local, national and international levels, have all played key roles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The programme is designed to provide you with the skills to understand how voters, political parties and politicians, civil servants, different governmental departments and agencies interact, whether proposing, modifying, blocking or implementing policies across the world. You will discuss current and past social policies and the analytical principles underlying them. Areas of study might include levels of social security benefits and their eligibility conditions, the nature of private-public partnerships in health service provision, or the mix of local authority schools and academies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Visit our YouTube channel to view&nbsp;<a title=\"Department of Social Policy videos\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK4elntcUEy0APAtNqejuM1JgEveafyOc\">Department of Social Policy videos</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Listen to our 2020 Virtual Open Day Social Policy&nbsp;<a accesskey=\"Social Policy VOD 2020 \" title=\"Social Policy VOD 2020 \" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200608BSc-Account.mp3\">Q&amp;A session.</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><em>This programme was previously known as BSc Social Policy with Government, and BSc International Social and Public Policy with Government.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

This degree is carefully structured so that the mathematical and statistical topics you study are those of greatest relevance to economics and finance.</p>\r\n<p>The Department of Mathematics is committed to excellence in teaching and research in mathematics related to the social sciences, particularly the mathematics necessary for understanding economics. The programme is taught jointly with LSE's world class Department of Economics and enables you to build a strong quantitative knowledge base &ndash; increasingly important for a successful career in economics and finance.

"<p>The study of politics involves analysis of the ways in which individuals and groups define and interpret political issues and seek to shape government decisions. It encompasses a broad spectrum of activities relating to public affairs, from elections and bureaucracies to wars and terrorism.</p>\r\n<p>International relations deals with the nature of the changing relations between states and with non-state actors. It studies the functioning of the international system &ndash; the forces, factors and interests, the customs, rules, norms, institutions and organisations from which the theory and history of its development are formed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This programme combines the two complementary fields of politics and international relations in a joint honours programme, with around half of the programme in each field. You will learn political concepts and theories, will compare political phenomena in a variety of cultures and countries, and answer broad theoretical questions about the political world. You will also gain insight into how the international community works, studying alongside students from a wide range of countries.</p>\r\n<p><strong><strong>Watch the recording of our 2020 Virtual Open Day Government&nbsp;<a accesskey=\"Session recording\" title=\"Session recording\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200619_governmentOnlineSession.mp4\">Q&amp;A session</a>.</strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

Over the course of six weeks, you&rsquo;ll contextualise foundational legal principles, apply behavioural economics concepts to data protection, and learn more about the legalities of data ownership.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developed by leading faculty from LSE's Department of Law, this course draws on the strengths of the department's innovative research and academic excellence to immerse you in topical legal debates about data protection, applicable regardless of your geographical or jurisdictional context. You&rsquo;ll develop the skills to think critically about the intersection of technology, law and policy, by engaging with topical case studies and data protection regulations, including the EU&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You&rsquo;ll also examine traditional regulatory models and how they are being replaced or supplemented by the application of algorithmic, data-driven decision-making.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This course is applicable to professionals from various contexts who are eager to understand the core legal concepts and debates surrounding data protection law and algorithmic regulation. Business professionals with an interest in the challenges posed by data protection legislation will benefit from both the practical and theoretical subject matter. Legal frameworks, case-studies and regulations are used as a practical illustration for discussion throughout the course, making it relevant to legal professionals such as regulators, policy makers, risk officers, lawyers, data protection officers, and compliance officers.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>CPD Certified</h3>\r\n<p>This course is certified by the United Kingdom CPD Certification Service, and

economics. You will learn how to apply economic concepts to policy issues and about the connections between them.</p>\r\n<p>International social and public policy covers real world issues such as poverty, disadvantage, international development, and welfare and work. It is about understanding and addressing social problems in society, and it examines the formation and implementation of policy, and how this affects people&rsquo;s wellbeing. Economics is the study of scarcity, how people use resources and make decisions. The discipline of economics&nbsp;tackles a broad range of problems at various levels, from individuals' work behaviour and economic choices to recessions, international finance and trade between countries.</p>\r\n<p>You will consider issues such as the fact that it is prosperous economies that can most easily introduce and support generous social policies; but the nature of social policy provision can have substantial impacts on how an economy performs. You will learn about issues facing societies around the world today such as how best to finance and provide cash benefits, health and social care, education and social services, and how the issues have been addressed in the past and in different countries. You will be taught about economic success at a national and international level (macroeconomics) and about the interactions of firms, governments and individuals within countries (microeconomics).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Visit our YouTube channel to view&nbsp;<a title=\"Department of Social Policy videos\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK4elntcUEy0APAtNqejuM1JgEveafyOc\">Department of Social Policy videos</a><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Listen to our 2020 Virtual Open Day Social Policy&nbsp;</strong><strong><strong><a accesskey=\"Social Policy VOD 2020 \" title=\"Social Policy VOD 2020 \" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200608BSc-Account.mp3\">Q&amp;A session.</a></strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

its minor subject; and the study of social policy will make up the majority of the degree.</p>\r\n<p>International social and public policy covers real world issues such as poverty, disadvantage, international development, and welfare and work. It is about understanding and addressing social problems in society, and it examines the formation and implementation of policy, and how this affects people&rsquo;s wellbeing. The subject is diverse and exciting, and plays a crucial role in contemporary politics. The study of government involves analysing the ways in which individuals and groups define and interpret political issues and seek to shape government decisions.</p>\r\n<p>Social policy and politics are closely linked. The social policies you see around you were not created in a vacuum but reflect an accumulation of decisions in which political behaviour by citizens and their representatives, and governments and other organisations at local, national and international levels, have all played key roles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The programme is designed to provide you with the skills to understand how voters, political parties and politicians, civil servants, different governmental departments and agencies interact, whether proposing, modifying, blocking or implementing policies across the world. You will discuss current and past social policies and the analytical principles underlying them. Areas of study might include levels of social security benefits and their eligibility conditions, the nature of private-public partnerships in health service provision, or the mix of local authority schools and academies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Visit our YouTube channel to view&nbsp;<a title=\"Department of Social Policy videos\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK4elntcUEy0APAtNqejuM1JgEveafyOc\">Department of Social Policy videos</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Listen to our 2020 Virtual Open Day Social Policy&nbsp;<a accesskey=\"Social Policy VOD 2020 \" title=\"Social Policy VOD 2020 \" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200608BSc-Account.mp3\">Q&amp;A session.</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><em>This programme was previously known as BSc Social Policy with Government, and BSc International Social and Public Policy with Government.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

It combines all the benefits of a qualifying law degree with the intellectual and philosophical challenge of anthropology: the study of what it means to be human. Students on the programme have a wide variety of interests, backgrounds and motivations.</p>\r\n<p>Studying anthropology will provide a framework to help you see what is universal to all human societies and what is variable. You will learn to analyse social and political relations and to engage productively in major contemporary debates concerning social justice, multiculturalism and the direction of political and economic change in today's world.</p>\r\n<p>The law components of the programme provide an insight into the legal system, as well as teaching you the technical procedures needed to practice law. It is a qualifying degree, meaning you can go straight from graduating to taking the LPC (Legal Practice Course).</p>\r\n<p>The programme also offers full training in anthropological research methods. You will have the opportunity to undertake an in-depth ethnographic study during your second year, take part in our Summer Fieldwork Placements scheme, and spend a year abroad at one of the Anthropology department's global partners.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Watch our&nbsp; Anthropology Q&amp;A session from our 2020 Undergraduate Virtual Open Day&nbsp;<a accesskey=\"Anthropology VOD 2020 QA\" title=\"Anthropology VOD 2020 QA\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200611_anthropologyOnlineSession.mp4\">here.</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

However a limited number of students successfully transfer to this programme from the BSc Economics in the third year (with the permission of the Undergraduate Tutor), in order to take part in the demanding and rewarding dissertation in quantitative economics.&nbsp;Students on this programme will enjoy the benefits of the new LSE economics undergraduate Year 1 and 2 curriculum, launched in 2021/22.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a accesskey=\"Listen to our podcast\" title=\"Listen to our podcast\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_studentrecruitment/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/studentrecruitment/20190403_UGopenDay_Economics.mp4\">Listen to our podcast</a> on studying economics at LSE, recorded at one of our Undergraduate Open Days.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

Developing an understanding of how to frame issues in regulation will enable you to enhance your performance and your competitive advantage in the commercial context.</p>\r\n<p>Case studies, presentations, group discussions and problem solving activities are all used so that you will come away with strategies to lower your costs and enable you to design, or make the case for, efficient regulatory systems and responses.</p>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll learn alongside professionals from around the world who have varying familiarity with regulation &ndash; as regulators, regulated concerns or other related parties &ndash; including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Regulators - whatever regulatory functions they carry out at any level</li>\r\n<li>Staff of regulated concerns</li>\r\n<li>Consultants on regulation</li>\r\n<li>Policy-makers who deal with regulatory issue</li>\r\n<li>Lawyers, accountants, economists and other advisors on regulatory matters.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The week will be of particular value to those who are moving into regulatory affairs from other areas and to those who have some regulatory experience but who wish to set their practical concerns within a broader framework of understanding. No prior knowledge of regulation, law or economics is assumed.</p>\r\n<p><b>Tuition fee: </b>&pound;3,995</p>\r\n<p>Includes all LSE tuition, course materials, daily lunches, and networking events. You will also be awarded an LSE certificate of completion at the end of the five days.</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"Executive Education Courses\"

digital data becomes the bedrock of all areas of business, an understanding of how the law applies to digital decision-making is essential for business professionals and executives globally.\"&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;Andrew Murray, Professor of Law, LSE</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Data: Law, Policy and Regulation online certificate course from LSE employs a socio-legal lense to empower you with an understanding of the changing legal environment shaping data law and policy. Over the course of six weeks, you&rsquo;ll contextualise foundational legal principles, apply behavioural economics concepts to data protection, and learn more about the legalities of data ownership.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developed by leading faculty from LSE's Department of Law, this course draws on the strengths of the department's innovative research and academic excellence to immerse you in topical legal debates about data protection, applicable regardless of your geographical or jurisdictional context. You&rsquo;ll develop the skills to think critically about the intersection of technology, law and policy, by engaging with topical case studies and data protection regulations, including the EU&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You&rsquo;ll also examine traditional regulatory models and how they are being replaced or supplemented by the application of algorithmic, data-driven decision-making.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This course is applicable to professionals from various contexts who are eager to understand the core legal concepts and debates surrounding data protection law and algorithmic regulation. Business professionals with an interest in the challenges posed by data protection legislation will benefit from both the practical and theoretical subject matter. Legal frameworks, case-studies and regulations are used as a practical illustration for discussion throughout the course, making it relevant to legal professionals such as regulators, policy makers, risk officers, lawyers, data protection officers, and compliance officers.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>CPD Certified</h3>\r\n<p>This course is certified by the United Kingdom CPD Certification Service, and may be applicable to individuals who are members of, or are associated with, UK-based professional bodies.&nbsp;The course has an estimated 60 hours of learning.&nbsp;</p>", "lsecCTAIcon3":

Taught by leading international experts through research-informed teaching, you will discuss the key debates in environment and development and explore the nature, drivers and politics of sustainable and unsustainable development. You will develop a critical understanding of processes of environmental change as they relate to human wellbeing and development, and gain the broader skills needed for environment and development policy and analysis. Across all years of the programme you will be able to choose from a range of options, including an international field-course, tailoring your studies to your areas of

It uses concepts and theories from across the social sciences to study the development of real economies and understand them in their social, political and cultural contexts. It combines the skills of the economist and the historian, the statistician and the sociologist. Meanwhile, economics tackles a broad range of problems, from barriers to economic development to international financial crises.</p>\r\n<p>This programme combines the two complementary fields of economic history and economics in a joint honours programme, with around half of the programme in economic history, and half in economics. It will appeal if you want training in the application of economic theory and quantitative methods to real problems. You will examine important global issues such as the economic and social effects of wars, the importance of education and human capital in economic change, and the history of economic development in the third world.</p>\r\n<p>You will complete a research project in your third year where you undertake an original piece of research on a topic of your choice. The programme will enable you to develop a range of research skills which are highly valued by employers across a variety of careers, including numeracy, the ability to evaluate and analyse data, and to present an argument orally or on paper.<br /><br /><strong>Watch a video about the <a title=\"BSc Economic History programmes at LSE\"

issues require graduates with economics training to understand and tackle environmental issues. This programme combines these two complementary fields, providing you with rigorous economics training as well as environmental social science learning. This is a major/minor programme, with around 75 per cent of this programme in environment, and the remaining 25 per cent in economics.</p>\r\n<p>Many staff members from the Department are directly engaged with policy debates, sitting on government panels or being contracted to do analysis for different policy issues. You&rsquo;ll learn not just academic theory, but why policies issues matter and why they&rsquo;re relevant. You&rsquo;re also able to see first-hand the impact LSE research has on the real world.</p>\r\n<p>You will acquire a broad range of social scientific skills and knowledge with which to tackle and understand environmental problems. In the second and third year of the programme you will be able to choose from a range of options, including an international field-course, tailoring your studies to your areas of interest.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Watch a video about the&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMiICZ4ThkQ\">BSc Environmental Policy with Economics

You will develop linguistic proficiency in Mandarin through two study abroad periods at Fudan University in Shanghai, and through increasingly specialist language courses that focus on international relations and professional practice.

study of economics with economic history (the study of economic events of the past)", "lsecIsVisibleFirstRowModules": false, "lsecIntroDescription": "<p>Economic history analyses how past economies have changed and the factors that have influenced economic development. It focuses on practical questions about real economies. For instance, why are some countries rich and others poor, what forces shape inequality and what does historical experience reveal about current global economic developments and crises? Meanwhile, economics provides an analytical framework with which to approach a wide range of problems. It tackles similar issues to economic history but with a focus on formal modelling of economic relationships and current issues.</p>\r\n<p>This programme combines the two complementary fields of economic history and economics in a joint honours programme, with around half of the programme in economic history, and half in economics. It will appeal if you want training in the application of economic theory and quantitative methods to real problems. You will take the theoretical and statistical learning from economics and apply this to understanding the historical development of economies around the world. Likewise, you will use the contextual knowledge and real-world historical evidence learned in economic history to understand economic concepts more deeply and gain insight into current economic issues.</p>\r\n<p>As part of your programme, you will complete a series of research projects based on primary historical sources. These culminate with a year-long dissertation project in your third year where you undertake an original piece of economic history research on a topic of your choice. These projects will help you develop a range of research skills which are highly valued by employers across a variety of careers. These include the ability to evaluate, analyse and visualise data and to present your findings persuasively in written and oral form.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a accesskey=\"Listen to our podcast\" title=\"Listen to our podcast\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_studentrecruitment/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/studentrecruitment/20190403_UGopenDay_EconomicHistory.mp4\">Listen to our podcast</a> on studying economic history at LSE, recorded at one of our Undergraduate Open Days.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

regulatory landscape continues to evolve, a sound understanding of the field is of equal value to those who work within regulatory organisations and those who are subject to regulation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The LSE Regulation: Theory, Strategy, and Practice online certificate course offers an engaging, multidisciplinary look at the topic of regulation. You&rsquo;ll engage with a cross-sectoral, contextualised approach to learning that will enable you to think critically about the regulatory environment as a whole. As a business leader, this will empower you to address regulatory change and its potential challenges, and in turn enhance your performance. Those working within the regulatory space will gain the knowledge and frameworks to critically examine and design regulatory systems and responses.</p>\r\n<p>The course aligns theory with the real world as it considers regulation through a practical lens, while still drawing on research-based academic material from LSE Law &ndash; one of the world's top law schools with an international reputation for the quality of its teaching and legal research.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over eight weeks, you&rsquo;ll unpack the different drivers of regulation and learn how to improve accountability in regulation through transparency and public participation. You&rsquo;ll also examine transnational regulation and the opportunities and challenges it brings as well as the links between risk and regulation.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>CPD Certified</h3>\r\n<p>This online certificate course is certified by the United Kingdom CPD Certification Service, and may be applicable to individuals who are members of, or are associated with, UK-based professional bodies.

foundational and philosophical questions alongside core courses in economics with this joint honours programme", "lsecIsVisibleFirstRowModules": false, "lsecIntroDescription": "<p>This unique joint degree, taught by globally leading departments of philosophy and economics, allows you to study foundational and philosophical questions alongside your core courses in economics. If you&rsquo;re interested in an economics degree, but would like to take your thinking to a deeper philosophical level, then this is the degree for you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Philosophy addresses challenging foundational questions in many fields, including ethics, politics and scientific methodology. It also involves training in rigorous argumentation, including formal logic and essay writing. Here are some examples of the kinds of questions addressed by different philosophical fields:</p>\r\n<p><b>Ethics:</b>&nbsp;What is a good life? How should we act?</p>\r\n<p><b>Metaphysics:</b>&nbsp;What is the nature of reality? Does God exist, or free will, or a mind-independent world?</p>\r\n<p><b>Epistemology:</b>&nbsp;What is knowledge, how do we gain it and what distinguishes it from mere belief?</p>\r\n<p><b>Political Philosophy:</b>&nbsp;How should society be organised?</p>\r\n<p><b>Philosophy of Science:</b>&nbsp;What is science, and what makes it successful? What is the role of values in science?</p>\r\n<p>Economics tackles a broad range of problems, from barriers to economic development to international financial crises. What caused the great economic crisis of 2008 and which policies were the right reaction? Why is there still a gender pay gap? Why, as economies grow richer, are people often not any happier? Economics considers broad-ranging real world issues such as these. In this programme, you will take an open-minded and scientific approach to such issues, using formal modelling of economic relationships, and testing hypotheses against data.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a accesskey=\"Listen to our podcast\" title=\"Listen to our podcast\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_studentrecruitment/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/studentrecruitment/20190403_UGopenDay_Philosophy.mp4\">Listen to our podcast</a> on studying philosophy at LSE, recorded at one of our Undergraduate Open Days.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

Populist discontent with economic globalisation and rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China have undermined confidence in the existing global political-economic order. Globalisation has had a profound impact on the world we live in, yet its continued rise can no longer be taken for granted.</p>\r\n<p>In today&rsquo;s volatile and unpredictable global order, it has become increasingly important for decision makers in business to have a grounded understanding of the various political, social, economic, technological and environmental drivers of global change.</p>\r\n<p>This course focusses on the core concepts for understanding globalisation and global change, from the disciplines of international relations, political science, political economy and macroeconomics. It addresses real world problems using historical reflection, conceptual discussion and in-depth case studies. You will explore key events that have shaped the evolution of globalisation from the 19th century until today.</p>\r\n<p>You will analyse, in particular, how corporate organisations are impacted by events such as the 2008 financial crisis, changes in global supply chains, global power shifts and the emergence of China as a global economic power, instability in key areas of the developing world, technological and environmental disruption from automation and robotics to cybersecurity and climate change, and the rise of populism in the western world.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>CPD

Instead, you must evaluate the process that led to the choice you made.\"</strong></em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--- Dr Barbara Fasolo, Associate Professor of Behavioural Science at LSE&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This highly interactive and collaborative online certificate course explores the science behind decision-making to enhance your problem-solving and critical thinking skills. It also equips you with a step-by-step process for formulating clear, unbiased decisions. Using LSE&rsquo;s proprietary tool &ndash; the Decision Canvas&trade; &ndash; you&rsquo;ll gain the structure necessary to consistently make improved and informed decisions in both your personal and professional capacity.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Learn how to compensate for blind spots in your decision-making process by exploring and interrogating cognitive bias and automatic judgements. By focusing on an informed awareness of debiasing and choice architecture, this course will improve your intuitive decision-making, and prepare you for an increasingly tech-reliant world that requires professionals to use their interpersonal skills to navigate change and uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This course also highlights the critical importance of teamwork and cooperation. By leveraging the diversity, experiences, and insight of your peers, you&rsquo;ll learn how to review decision challenges from different perspectives and be exposed to alternative solutions. By combining theory with practical studies, you&rsquo;ll gain a framework to apply in your own context to enhance your decision-making process.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>CPD Certified</h3>\r\n<p>This

Since the United Nations&rsquo; official adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, global spending on healthcare has grown significantly, reaching 10 per cent of global GDP by 2017. In the same period, low-income countries spent $41 per capita on health, compared to $2,937 in high-income countries.*</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the Health Economics and Policy online certificate course, you&rsquo;ll use economic principles and how they relate to healthcare to explore the challenges facing the industry. You&rsquo;ll also engage with policy proposals designed to address inequality in the system. Alongside mechanisms such as supply and demand, you&rsquo;ll gain insight into healthcare financing systems and universal health coverage, and will explore the complexities of the healthcare labour market. Finally, you&rsquo;ll develop a balanced view of health and social justice, allowing you to assess the inequalities and social determinants of health, and make justifiable decisions regarding fairness in the system.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This course has been designed by faculty from the Department of Health Policy at LSE. Bringing together interdisciplinary research and teaching, the Department aims to influence and improve how health policy is designed, implemented, and evaluated. Experts and alumni from the Department have made substantive contributions to health planning and delivery on the global stage, working as policy specialists in governments, NGOs, and the private sector.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">*<a href=\"https://www.who.int/health_financing/documents/health-expenditure-report-2019/en/\">World Health Organization</a> (2019).</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>CPD

It combines all the benefits of a qualifying law degree with the intellectual and philosophical challenge of anthropology: the study of what it means to be human. Students on the programme have a wide variety of interests, backgrounds and motivations.</p>\r\n<p>Studying anthropology will provide a framework to help you see what is universal to all human societies and what is variable. You will learn to analyse social and political relations and to engage productively in major contemporary debates concerning social justice, multiculturalism and the direction of political and economic change in today's world.</p>\r\n<p>The law components of the programme provide an insight into the legal system, as well as teaching you the technical procedures needed to practice law. It is a qualifying degree, meaning you can go straight from graduating to taking the LPC (Legal Practice Course).</p>\r\n<p>The programme also offers full training in anthropological research methods. You will have the opportunity to undertake an in-depth ethnographic study during your second year, take part in our Summer Fieldwork Placements scheme, and spend a year abroad at one of the Anthropology department's global partners.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Watch our&nbsp; Anthropology Q&amp;A session from our 2020 Undergraduate Virtual Open Day&nbsp;<a accesskey=\"Anthropology VOD 2020 QA\" title=\"Anthropology VOD 2020 QA\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200611_anthropologyOnlineSession.mp4\">here.</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

You will also learn to appreciate the interdependencies between accounting and accountability, financial management and risk, performance management and sustainability, governance and regulation, policy making and change, among other key fundamental concepts related to, implicated in, or affected by accounting and finance. You will learn to critically evaluate the use and suitability of accounting and finance techniques in different contexts. You will gain a deep understanding of the nature of organisations in the economy and society, and the crucial role that accounting and finance play in societies, economies, institutions, markets, organisations, and even individual behaviours.</p>\r\n<p>This diverse social science approach to accounting and finance makes our graduating students highly sought after by a wide range of organisations globally in any area related to accounting or finance, and even beyond into other areas. Recent graduates of this programme have gone on to work in the areas of professional accountancy, investment banking, investment analysis, management consultancy and financial management, but also in the public sector as well as into further academic study.&nbsp;If you successfully complete the degree, then depending on the optional courses you have taken, you may be eligible for exemptions for some examinations of the professional accountancy bodies.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Watch a video about the <a title=\"Department of Accounting\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_Rb-px-wZg&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLK4elntcUEy2kjz2enWFxFX3BsyjqZhiI\">Department of Accounting</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Watch our BSc Accounting and Finance Q&amp;A sessions from our 2020 Virtual Undergraduate Open Day&nbsp;<a accesskey=\"Accounting and Finance VOD 2020 QA\" title=\"Accounting and Finance VOD 2020 QA\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200605_accountingOnlineSession.mp4\">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a accesskey=\"Accounting and Finance VOD 2020 Session 2\" title=\"Accounting and Finance VOD 2020 Session 2\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200608-100529_BSc-Accounting.mp4\">here</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

Taught by leading international experts through research-informed teaching, you will discuss the key debates in environment and development and explore the nature, drivers and politics of sustainable and unsustainable development.

It focuses on practical questions about real economies. For instance, why are some countries rich and others poor, what forces shape inequality and what does historical experience reveal about current global economic developments and crises? Meanwhile, economics provides an analytical framework with which to approach a wide range of problems. It tackles similar issues to economic history but with a focus on formal modelling of economic relationships and current issues.</p>\r\n<p>This programme combines the two complementary fields of economic history and economics in a joint honours programme, with around half of the programme in economic history, and half in economics. It will appeal if you want training in the application of economic theory and quantitative methods to real problems. You will take the theoretical and statistical learning from economics and apply this to understanding the historical development of economies around the world. Likewise, you will use the contextual knowledge and real-world historical evidence learned in economic history to understand economic concepts more deeply and gain insight into current economic issues.</p>\r\n<p>As part of your programme, you will complete a series of research projects based on primary historical sources. These culminate with a year-long dissertation project in your third year where you undertake an original piece of economic history research on a topic of your choice. These projects will help you develop a range of research skills which are highly valued by employers across a variety of careers. These include the ability to evaluate, analyse and visualise data and to present your findings persuasively in written and oral form.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a accesskey=\"Listen to our podcast\" title=\"Listen to our podcast\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_studentrecruitment/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/studentrecruitment/20190403_UGopenDay_EconomicHistory.mp4\">Listen to our podcast</a> on studying economic history at LSE, recorded at one of our Undergraduate Open Days.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

"lsecIntroDescription": "<p>The LLB Bachelor of Laws degree teaches you to understand and critically analyse the rules and institutions which society establishes to secure and promote justice and order.</p>\r\n<p>Our degree emphasises an understanding of law in context. We aim to encourage a broad outlook on legal issues, an understanding of the functions of law and of the legal system, and an appreciation of the place of rules of law in the construction of politics and society. Students learn that law is not a body of knowledge stored in libraries, but a presence all around us, constantly evident in our social, civil and business interactions. To study law with us is not to amass large quantities of stored information, but to explore key issues of fundamental importance to society.</p>\r\n<p>The study of law involves the acquisition of a variety of intellectual skills. In addition to being a preparation for the legal profession, the creative and imaginative powers of reasoning that the study of law develops are valued by many employers. So whilst this is a qualifying degree, meaning you can go straight from graduating to taking the LPC (Legal Practice Course), many students enjoy the intellectual challenge of a law degree before embarking on a career in a range of other sectors.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the LLB degree, the Department offers a double degree programme with Columbia University Law School in New York. This LSE LLB/JD (juris doctor) programme is open to a limited number of LLB students and applications are invited during the second year of study.

It is about understanding and addressing social problems in society, and it examines the formation and implementation of policy, and how this affects people&rsquo;s wellbeing. Economics is the study of scarcity, how people use resources and make decisions. The discipline of economics&nbsp;tackles a broad range of problems at various levels, from individuals' work behaviour and economic choices to recessions, international finance and trade between countries.</p>\r\n<p>You will consider issues such as the fact that it is prosperous economies that can most easily introduce and support generous social policies; but the nature of social policy provision can have substantial impacts on how an economy performs. You will learn about issues facing societies around the world today such as how best to finance and provide cash benefits, health and social care, education and social services, and how the issues have been addressed in the past and in different countries. You will be taught about economic success at a national and international level (macroeconomics) and about the interactions of firms, governments and individuals within countries (microeconomics).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Visit our YouTube channel to view&nbsp;<a title=\"Department of Social Policy videos\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK4elntcUEy0APAtNqejuM1JgEveafyOc\">Department of Social Policy videos</a><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Listen to our 2020 Virtual Open Day Social Policy&nbsp;</strong><strong><strong><a accesskey=\"Social Policy VOD 2020 \" title=\"Social Policy VOD 2020 \" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200608BSc-Account.mp3\">Q&amp;A session.</a></strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

They learn how to understand organisations and management practice through the rigorous lenses of economics, finance, statistics, mathematics and accounting.</p>\r\n<p>The curriculum focuses on critical thinking and problem solving, using logic and analysis. Students are encouraged to consider theory and evidence: \"What data might support this claim?\", &ldquo;How can we evaluate whether the data do support this claim?&rdquo;, \"What are the unstated assumptions behind this statement?\" This disciplinary training is complemented by a series of courses focusing on the key functions of the modern organisation, so that graduating students have good business sense alongside strong theoretical understanding.</p>\r\n<p>The programme also develops practical management competence, including the ability to work in teams, to write clearly both for managerial and scientific purposes, to conduct robust and valid quantitative analysis and present the results, and to give oral presentations. These skills are developed throughout the degree programme starting from the first year. Moreover, through LSE100 and the compulsory course in organisational strategy, as well as through many public events organised by the Department and the School, the programme presents an unrivalled opportunity to develop strategic awareness and breadth of perspective.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, the BSc Management programme is quantitative in nature and focuses on a theoretical understanding of various social sciences that are of relevance to Management.</p>\r\n<p>Students also have the opportunity to apply to spend a year studying abroad at one of our global partners, between their second and third years of the BSc Management programme.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Watch our BSc Management 2020 Virtual Open Day Q&amp;A&nbsp;<a accesskey=\"Management VOD 2020 QA\" title=\"Management VOD 2020 QA\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200611_managementOnlineSession.mp4\">session.</a><a accesskey=\"Management VOD 2020 QA\" title=\"Management VOD 2020 QA\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200611_managementOnlineSession.mp4\"><br /></a></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

You will learn to think analytically and to critically evaluate key issues in finance from a variety of perspectives. You will also learn to apply the analytical methods in finance and financial economics you have learn to a range of real world problems.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Watch a video about the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnupmXnQfzo&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLB2875B624793C6CE\">BSc Finance programme</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Watch our 2020 Virtual Open Day BSc Finance Q&amp;A session&nbsp;<a accesskey=\"Finance VOD Q&amp;A 2020\" title=\"Finance VOD Q&amp;A 2020\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200618_bScFinanceOnlineSession.mp4\">here</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

Since the United Nations&rsquo; official adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, global spending on healthcare has grown significantly, reaching 10 per cent of global GDP by 2017. In the same period, low-income countries spent $41 per capita on health, compared to $2,937 in high-income countries.*</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the Health Economics and Policy online certificate course, you&rsquo;ll use economic principles and how they relate to healthcare to explore the challenges facing the industry. You&rsquo;ll also engage with policy proposals designed to address inequality in the system. Alongside mechanisms such as supply and demand, you&rsquo;ll gain insight into healthcare financing systems and universal health coverage, and will explore the complexities of the healthcare labour market. Finally, you&rsquo;ll develop a balanced view of health and social justice, allowing you to assess the inequalities and social determinants of health, and make justifiable decisions regarding fairness in the system.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This course has been designed by faculty from the Department of Health Policy at LSE. Bringing together interdisciplinary research and teaching, the Department aims to influence and improve how health policy is designed, implemented, and evaluated.

undergraduate BSc Accounting &amp; Finance programme is topically focused on accounting and finance but is fundamentally grounded in other core social science disciplines as well as practically connected to the social sciences through optional courses and LSE100.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, in addition to developing core knowledge and skills in accounting and finance, you will learn to analyse how accounting and finance is concerned with a range of institutional and organisational processes of calculation, reporting, and evaluation. You will also learn to appreciate the interdependencies between accounting and accountability, financial management and risk, performance management and sustainability, governance and regulation, policy making and change, among other key fundamental concepts related to, implicated in, or affected by accounting and finance. You will learn to critically evaluate the use and suitability of accounting and finance techniques in different contexts. You will gain a deep understanding of the nature of organisations in the economy and society, and the crucial role that accounting and finance play in societies, economies, institutions, markets, organisations, and even individual behaviours.</p>\r\n<p>This diverse social science approach to accounting and finance makes our graduating students highly sought after by a wide range of organisations globally in any area related to accounting or finance, and even beyond into other areas. Recent graduates of this programme have gone on to work in the areas of professional accountancy, investment banking, investment analysis, management consultancy and financial management, but also in the public sector as well as into further academic study.&nbsp;If you successfully complete the degree, then depending on the optional courses you have taken, you may be eligible for exemptions for some examinations of the professional accountancy bodies.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Watch a video about the <a title=\"Department of Accounting\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_Rb-px-wZg&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLK4elntcUEy2kjz2enWFxFX3BsyjqZhiI\">Department of Accounting</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Watch our BSc Accounting and Finance Q&amp;A sessions from our 2020 Virtual Undergraduate Open Day&nbsp;<a accesskey=\"Accounting and Finance VOD 2020 QA\" title=\"Accounting and Finance VOD 2020 QA\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200605_accountingOnlineSession.mp4\">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a accesskey=\"Accounting and Finance VOD 2020 Session 2\" title=\"Accounting and Finance VOD 2020 Session 2\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200608-100529_BSc-Accounting.mp4\">here</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

It encompasses a broad spectrum of activities relating to public affairs, from elections and bureaucracies to wars and terrorism. History is a wide ranging and challenging subject to study. It seeks to understand the past and to make sense of the present, adding an important dimension to the understanding of many aspects of human society.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This programme combines the two complementary fields of history and politics in a joint honours programme, with around half of the programme in each field. It will provide you with insight into the interaction between political ideas and institutions, and historical developments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You will learn political concepts and theories, will compare political phenomena in a variety of cultures and countries, and answer broad theoretical questions about the political world. You will learn to analyse complex evidence from a variety of sources, to develop your analytical powers and to present your findings effectively.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Watch the recording of our 2020 Virtual Open Day Government&nbsp;<a accesskey=\"Session recording\" title=\"Session recording\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200619_governmentOnlineSession.mp4\">Q&amp;A session</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>This programme was previously known as BSc Government and History.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

width=\"2667\" src=\"/study-at-lse/executive-education/short-courses/assets/images/Regulation.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n<h2>5 day intensive programme (dates TBC)</h2>\r\n<p>This five-day course introduces you to the central issues in regulatory strategy and aids the development of your understanding in these key areas. It is directed by Professor Robert Baldwin and has established a worldwide reputation over the last decade. Presentations are delivered by a renowned group of academics from the Law and the Government Departments at LSE and the course also involves contributions by regulatory practitioners.</p>\r\n<p>The course is of great value whether you work within a regulatory organisation, or are somebody who is subject to regulation. Developing an understanding of how to frame issues in regulation will enable you to enhance your performance and your competitive advantage in the commercial context.</p>\r\n<p>Case studies, presentations, group discussions and problem solving activities are all used so that you will come away with strategies to lower your costs and enable you to design, or make the case for, efficient regulatory systems and responses.</p>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll learn alongside professionals from around the world who have varying familiarity with regulation &ndash; as regulators, regulated concerns or other related parties &ndash; including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Regulators - whatever regulatory functions they carry out at any level</li>\r\n<li>Staff of regulated concerns</li>\r\n<li>Consultants on regulation</li>\r\n<li>Policy-makers who deal with regulatory issue</li>\r\n<li>Lawyers, accountants, economists and other advisors on regulatory matters.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The week will be of particular value to those who are moving into regulatory affairs from other areas and to those who have some regulatory experience but who wish to set their practical concerns within a broader framework of understanding. No prior knowledge of regulation, law or economics is assumed.</p>\r\n<p><b>Tuition fee: </b>&pound;3,995</p>\r\n<p>Includes all LSE tuition, course materials, daily lunches, and networking events. You will also be awarded an LSE certificate of completion at the end of the five days.</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"Executive Education Courses\"

societies overcome poverty to create healthy, wealthy and sustainable societies - and why some persistently fail to achieve this - are common questions in Development Studies and Economic History.&nbsp; By combining courses from both fields, you will pursue a high quality programme that combines the in-depth analysis of longer-run historical patterns of growth, explorations of concrete development problems - and policy responses to them, and 'regional' courses that draw on theory and empirical evidence to appraise long and short-run development processes and outcomes in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.</p>\r\n<p>The programme brings together the analysis of long-run growth with modern approaches to development policy and practice.&nbsp; The full-unit core course in Development introduces you to the theories and historical experience of development, as well as cutting-edge policy debates.&nbsp; The core couse in Economic History gives you a rigorous exposure to core issues involved in analysing long-run historical change.&nbsp; You will choose from a wide range of elective courses in both departments, allowing you to compile a programme according to your interests and goals, and will write a dissertation on an approved topic of your choice.</p>\r\n<p>The programme brings together students from diverse academic and professional backgrounds.&nbsp; It is relevant for students planning a career in development work, including international and national agencies and NGOs, as well as international business.&nbsp; The programme also provides a good

programme is designed to develop your analytical and critical skills in the core strategic issues facing managers and organisations in today&rsquo;s fast-moving global business world. It will give you a fundamental understanding of incentives and governance, organisational design, individual and group decision-making, and strategy in competition and markets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Informed by practice</strong>. The programme links critical analysis with practice, by combining the analytical rigour of an economics degree with real-world, contemporary case studies. Throughout the programme you will be challenged to understand and apply cutting-edge managerial and economic theory to examples from the real world.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Problem solving</strong>. With a strong focus on economic business analysis, you will learn to rigorously examine managerial challenges using economic techniques, and to recommend your own innovative, intelligent solutions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Real world relevance</strong>.

As a multidisciplinary subject, it draws on theories and expertise from subjects such as sociology, politics and economics.</p>\r\n<p>The BSc International Social and Public Policy aims to provide an understanding of how policies are formulated and implemented in industrialised societies, transition economies and the Global South. The Department takes a comparative, international and contemporary perspective: investigating the changing role of states, the non-profit sector, the market and informal providers like families and communities in producing social welfare.</p>\r\n<p>You will study a broad range of topics from social, economic and political standpoints. These include citizenship, education, health and social care, international development and urbanisation as well as cross-cutting dimensions such as gender, ethnicity and the impact of globalisation.&nbsp;You will examine issues such as poverty and wellbeing, levels of social protection and their eligibility conditions, the nature of private-public partnerships, or the mix of public and private schools.</p>\r\n<p>You can also choose to take a specialism in Development, which focuses on middle and low-income countries and the way in which social and public policy are discussed, produced and implemented to deal with inequalities and to increase wellbeing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Visit our YouTube channel to view <a title=\"Department of Social Policy videos\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK4elntcUEy0APAtNqejuM1JgEveafyOc\">Department of Social Policy videos</a><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Listen to our 2020 Virtual Open Day Social Policy <a accesskey=\"Social Policy VOD 2020 \" title=\"Social Policy VOD 2020 \" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200608BSc-Account.mp3\">Q&amp;A session.</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

The Department takes a comparative, international and contemporary perspective: investigating the changing role of states, the non-profit sector, the market and informal providers like families and communities in producing social welfare.</p>\r\n<p>You will study a broad range of topics from social, economic and political standpoints. These include citizenship, education, health and social care, international development and urbanisation as well as cross-cutting dimensions such as gender, ethnicity and the impact of globalisation.&nbsp;You will examine issues such as poverty and wellbeing, levels of social protection and their eligibility conditions, the nature of private-public partnerships, or the mix of public and private schools.</p>\r\n<p>You can also choose to take a specialism in Development, which focuses on middle and low-income countries and the way in which social and public policy are discussed, produced and implemented to deal with inequalities and to increase wellbeing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Visit our YouTube channel to view <a title=\"Department of Social Policy videos\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK4elntcUEy0APAtNqejuM1JgEveafyOc\">Department of Social Policy videos</a><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Listen to our 2020 Virtual Open Day Social Policy <a accesskey=\"Social Policy VOD 2020 \" title=\"Social Policy VOD 2020 \" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_ard/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/ard/20200608BSc-Account.mp3\">Q&amp;A session.</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

It also involves training in rigorous argumentation, including formal logic and essay writing. Here are some examples of the kinds of questions addressed by different philosophical fields:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ethics</strong>: What is a good life? How should we act?<br /><strong>Metaphysics</strong>: What is the nature of reality? Does God exist, or free will, or a mind-independent world?<br /><strong>Epistemology</strong>: What is knowledge, and what distinguishes it from mere belief?<br /><strong>Political</strong> <strong>Philosophy</strong>: How should society be organised?<br /><strong>Philosophy</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Science</strong>: What is science, and what makes it successful? What is the role of values in science?</p>\r\n<p>Students on this programme also have the opportunity to receive a language specialism attached to their degree certificate and transcript - see the programme structure and courses section.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a accesskey=\"Listen to our podcast\" title=\"Listen to our podcast\" href=\"https://media.rawvoice.com/lse_studentrecruitment/richmedia.lse.ac.uk/studentrecruitment/20190403_UGopenDay_Philosophy.mp4\">Listen to our podcast</a>&nbsp;on studying philosophy at LSE, recorded at one of our Undergraduate Open Days.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><i>Teaching and learning in 2021</i></strong><br /> <i>We hope that programmes beginning in September 2021 will be unaffected by Coronavirus.

Page\" height=\"300\" width=\"600\" src=\"/study-at-lse/Online-learning/Assets/Images/CSI-Course-Page.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Industries are led by organisations that know how to harness innovation to win and sustain a competitive advantage. Those that lack a consistent approach to innovation often fall behind. Whether responding to pandemics such as COVID-19, technological change or customers' growing concerns for the environment, systematic innovation management proves invaluable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Competitive Strategy and Innovation online certificate empowers strategic leaders to make informed decisions about fostering and resourcing the right innovations for the most positive business impact, and is relevant for all professionals impacted by disruption.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over eight weeks, the course teaches you to identify and leverage existing resources in your organisation to set your business apart. By adopting a resource-based view, you&rsquo;ll approach innovation through a practical lens as you identify your business&rsquo;s unique capabilities and analyse how your current assets can be used to your competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through a combination of problem-based learning scenarios and authentic case studies, the course will teach you underlying principles of competitive strategy, but also how to translate them into action. You&rsquo;ll discover frameworks that can be used to evaluate your existing resources, stimulate and manage innovation, and build a long-term competitive strategy. The course also illustrates several practical examples of innovation in response to the COVID-19 disruption. Using tools such as design thinking, blue ocean strategy, and customer journey mapping, you'll be better equipped to drive your business forward in the face of uncertainty.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>CPD
