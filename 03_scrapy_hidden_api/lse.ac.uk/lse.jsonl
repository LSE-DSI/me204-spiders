href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2021/MSc-International-Health-Policy\">MSc International Health Policy&nbsp;programme</a> which allows you to study and specialise in advanced health economics.&nbsp;You will learn advanced principles of health economics, statistical methods and econometrics and learn to apply them in examining important issues in health policy.</p>\r\n<p>The programme offers an international perspective on health economics, and although concentrating primarily on high-income countries, there are some courses that cover the economics of low- and middle-income countries. The majority of your professors on the programme are specialists in health economics,&nbsp;and have conducted applied health economics and policy research in a range of settings.</p>\r\n<p>Students should have prior knowledge of economics as many of the individual courses are designed for economists wanting to specialise in health care, but those with quantitative skills should not be deterred.</p>\r\n<p>The programme prepares you for a career in a range of areas where health economists are essential.

With a select intake, the programme gives you a powerful networking opportunity with a diverse cohort of international students. The programme is taught in four intensive weeks, weekly evening sessions, and two 'policy weekend retreats'. This structure is designed to allow time-pressured professionals to combine their existing jobs with study.

We study digital innovation in business and government across the world.Â Digital innovationsÂ are drastically changing the ways we create and share information, and open opportunities for new business models, new forms of governance, and new ways for public engagement. Managers with the capability to capitalise on new digital developments are highly sought after in the job market. The MISDI programme prepares students for key roles in the shaping of digital innovation and in the management of the business and social transformation that such innovation unleashes.Â  The programme involves research led, practice relevant teaching. Our learning approach places emphasis on theory and critical discussion of academic literature from across a range of scientific fields. We include social theories for understanding the processes of information systems and innovation and case studies for illustrating issues in particular instances of management and innovation practice.Â  iSChannel student journal âBefore starting the programme, I did not imagine that technology could be studied at such a level of depth and reflection in regard to its social and human implications.

It introduces key problems with the foundations of human rights and considers the possibilities for new political foundations for human rights in a period of accelerating economic inequality and technological change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Interdisciplinary in nature, it draws on sociology, political theory, political sociology and philosophy to investigate international human rights. The subject matter is international in scope. This master's is intended to appeal to those who want to study the politics of international human rights but who do not necessarily want to pursue a legal route to a human rights or related career.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The MSc Human Rights and Politics aims to equip you with interdisciplinary academic knowledge of the main challenges and problems affecting human rights theories, institutions, movements and practice in the world today. You will engage in a rigorous way with key human rights areas, including the many crises facing human rights thinking and human rights institutions. A key aim is to move away from discussion of international law and the UN Charter Regime and concentrate on the sociology and politics of human rights in today's world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The programme links theoretical and empirical issues in human rights with political sociology and political philosophy using a variety of critical and analytical perspectives. Substantive themes covered in the programme may change from year to year, but indicative areas in the core course include: the threats to human rights; power and human rights institutions; the limits of political liberalism; the rise of authoritarian populism; movements against racism and white supremacism; wars and self-determination; development and human rights; identity politics; sexuality, sex, gender and human rights; human rights and coloniality; care, dignity and the renewal of human rights. You will also undertake an independent graduate dissertation. The core course and dissertation promote interdisciplinary understandings of human rights and the multiple challenges they face.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The programme is closely connected to LSE Human Rights in the Department of Sociology. In addition to research, LSE Human Rights runs a very active public events programme which includes public lectures, visiting speaker seminars and conferences involving world-leading human rights academics and practitioners. You will also benefit from masterclasses and guest practitioner seminars organised for students on the programme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You will take a compulsory course on the contemporary politics of human rights, and will have the opportunity to choose courses from a range of available options in sociology, anthropology, development, gender, politics, international relations, and more. You will also complete a dissertation on an approved topic.</p>\r\n<i><i><br /></i></i>", "lsecCTAIcon3": "/study-at-lse/Graduate/Assets/CTAs/Register-your-interest-CTA.aspx", "lsecStudyFromAbroad": false, "lsecCTAIcon2": "/study-at-lse/Graduate/Assets/CTAs/Virtual-Graduate-Open-Day-CTA/Virtual-Graduate-Open-Day-LSE-CTA.aspx", "lsecCTAIcon1": "/study-at-lse/Graduate/Assets/CTAs/How-to-apply-CTA.aspx", "lsecYear": {"path": "Root/StructuredContent/Courses/Years/2024", "key": "0/1/26/94/1806", "hasChildren": false, "name": "2024", "children": []}, "searchDataKeywords": null, "lsecPartTimeAvailability": {"path": "Root/StructuredContent/Courses/Availability/Open", "key": "0/1/26/27/28", "hasChildren": false, "name": "Open", "children": []}, "lsecDepartmentPage": "/sociology/home.aspx", "searchDataModifiedDate": "2023-10-09T14:00:53.947", "lsecRelatedProgrammeCheck5": false, "lsecRelatedProgrammeCheck4": false, "lsecCode": "L3UL", "lsecRelatedProgrammeCheck3": true, "lsecRelatedProgrammeCheck2": true, "lsecIsShortCourses": false, "lsecLocations": [{"path": "Root/StructuredContent/Courses/Locations/Houghton Street, London", "key": "0/1/26/114/115", "hasChildren": false, "name": "Houghton Street, London", "children": []}], "lsecStoryImageDescription": null, "lsecFullTimeDuration": "12 months", "lsecIsDistanceLearningPartTime": false, "entryTitle": "MSc Human Rights and Politics", "lsecIsPartTime": true, "lsecRelatedProgramme2": "/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2024/MPhilPhD-Sociology/Home.aspx", "lsecRelatedProgramme3": "/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2024/MSc-City-Design-and-Social-Science/Home.aspx", "lsecRelatedProgramme4": null, "lsecDepartment": {"path": "Root/StructuredContent/Courses/Departments/Department of Sociology", "key": "0/1/26/97/333", "hasChildren": false, "name": "Department of Sociology", "children": []}, "lsecRelatedProgramme5": null, "searchDataTitle": "MSc Human Rights and Politics", "lsecRelatedProgramme1": null, "sys": {"owner": "StructuredContentImport", "metadata": {"property_DatePublished": "2023-09-19T07:28:00", "property_Path": "/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2024/MSc-Human-Rights-and-Politics", "property_IsPageFolderHome": 32333, "property_CT_ID": 0, "property_ImageHeight": 0, "sC_RenderedHtml": "<p>The MSc Human Rights and Politics programme provides a rigorous year-long academic engagement with critical political issues faced by international human rights today.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The programme covers the multiple challenges that human rights thinking, institutions and activism are facing in the current period, a period during which many states, movements and political figures are turning towards populist nationalism and anti-minority discrimination.

It introduces key problems with the foundations of human rights and considers the possibilities for new political foundations for human rights in a period of accelerating economic inequality and technological change.Â  Interdisciplinary in nature, it draws on sociology, political theory, political sociology and philosophy to investigate international human rights. The subject matter is international in scope.

globalisation of the world economy and the rapid expansion of world trade are among some of the changes affecting economic development today.</p>\r\n<p>In this context, local and regional economies increasingly need new responses and demand specialist skills to exploit the opportunities these changes offer. The MSc Local Economic Development, accredited by the Institute for Economic Development (IED), prepares you to meet these challenges.</p>\r\n<p>You will focus on the variety of ways in which local and regional agencies can work with the private sector in order to stimulate local economies.
